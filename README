Use:
    - Run ebay_search.py

    - Enter your budget, only items below your budget will be returned
        - Items that have a ranged price are sorted based on the average price

Testing:
    - We tested by inputing things we would really buy on Ebay
    - We followed the link provided by the program to see if it met our filters and budget
    - We looked at each result to see that seller reviews descend from highest rated seller to lowest

Requirements: 
    - This program requires the python requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries 
    - These can be installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt
